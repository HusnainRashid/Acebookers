# MongoDB User Collections Design

MongoDB is no SQL database

| SQL           | MongoDB                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Table         | Collection                               |
| Field         | Key / Property                           |
| Record        | Document                                 |
| Relationships | Embedded documents / document references |

## User Specification

```
As a user, so that I can use Acebook from my personal account, I would like to sign up.

As a logged in user, so that I can share what I am doing online, i want to be able to make posts

As a logged in user, so I can keep up to date with what other people are doing, I want to see their posts

As a logged in user, so I can let people know I enjoy their post, I want to be able to like a post

As a logged in user, so that I know who is interacting with my posts, I want to see likes and comments on my posts

As a user, so that I can see latest posts first, I would like to view posts on a feed in reverse chronological order

```
